/*
 * Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
 * 
 * ex:
 * To run a home theater one needs to have Amplifier, Tuner, CdPlayer, Screen, DvdPlayer, Projector,
 * TheaterLights etc.
 * So, instead of exposing all the classes which will be unnecessary, one can create a fatter interface of HomeTheater
 * which will be relevant to the client
 * class HomeTheater :
 *   +watchMovie()
 *   +endMovie()
 *   +listenToCd()
 *   +endCd()
 *   +listenToRadio()
 *   +endRadio()
