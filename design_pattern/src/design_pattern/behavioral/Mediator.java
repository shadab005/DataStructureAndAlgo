/*
 * 
 * Use the   Mediator Pattern to centralize complex communications and control between related objects.
 * 
 * Difference between Mediator and Facade
 * The facade exposes existing functionality and the mediator adds to the existing functionality.
 * 
 * ex:
 * A great real world example of mediator pattern is traffic control room at airports. 
 * If all flights will have to interact with each other for finding which flight is going to land next, it will create a big mess.
