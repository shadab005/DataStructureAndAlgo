Elevator design for a building with multiple elevator

A person standing on floor and call the elevator
1.  Request goest to elevator manager and it selects the elevator to serve the request
2.  Inside an elevator any button press will invoke an action
	There are two types of buton inside an elevator for now
	FloorButton that adds request to go to a particular floor
	Stop button to make the elevator stop.

3. When a request comes to elevator to for it to move to some floor, then it invokes the
   request scheduler to take care of it by calling its addRequest method
   
4. Request scheduler will continuouslly fetch next request to serve, serve the request and
   then repeat. FCFSRequestScheduler is one of the concrete class and should be using first come
   first serve request serving model.
