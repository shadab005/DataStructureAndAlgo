Assignment Service exposes the api assignmentFunction responsible for returning list of Assignment as 
per the priority. AssigmentService has information of List<Order> and List<DeliveryExecutive>
And an Assignment contains information of Order and DeliveryExecutive.

We have rule engine to which we set different set of rules in the order of priority and 
we can change by setting different rules in differnt orders.

A rule engine exposes evalute funtion which takes Assignment as input and calculates 
how much weightage cost the Assignment has. More the weightage cost better the Assignment of an Order
to a delivery executive.


Steps:
Client calls AssignmentService assignmentFunction to fetch List<Assignment>
AsignmentServive for each combination of Order and Delivery executive it creates Assignment 
and invokes the ruleEngine to calculate the weightage of it.
RuleEngine runs the assignment to each rule and get the total cost as per the priority.
AssignmentService then returns the result  based on this weighted cost.
