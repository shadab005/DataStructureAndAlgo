1. How to scale this approach to whole city ?
City can be divided into small regions identified by each region code. Given any location it can be mapped
to some region code.

So we will have information of
{region_code, order_location}
{region_code, delivery_executives}

So for any order placed  placed with a restuarant region code will be fetched
For this region codes all the orders will be fecthed which i yet to be assigned.
All the delivery executives free willbe fetcched.  
And then the AssignmentService will be called to get the list of Assignment


2. How to fetch DEs to be mapped with order?
Both order and DEs will be mapped to region_id based on the location.
From order we wil fetch the region_id and then from region_id we will fetch the delivery executives for that
region.

3. Some areas might want to increase efficiency i.e maximum utilization of delivery boys.
On the other hand, some might want to increase quality i.e prioritize order delay, equal
distribution of orders among delivery boys. How should the code be designed so that
these factors can be easily incorporated in future?

This is already taken care off in the design. We will add rules to rule engine based on the order of priority.
So we will define order of rules according to the area and initalize the rule engine accordingly.
