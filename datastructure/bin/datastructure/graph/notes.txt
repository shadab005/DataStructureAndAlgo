Application of dfs:
1.Topological sorting
2.Solving puzzles such as maze

Application of bfs:
1.Find all shortest path between two nodes
2.Testing a graph for bipartiteness.



A Hamiltonian path, also called a Hamilton path, is a graph path between two vertices of a graph that visits each vertex exactly once.
If a Hamiltonian path exists whose endpoints are adjacent, 
then the resulting graph cycle is called a Hamiltonian cycle (or Hamiltonian cycle). 
A graph that possesses a Hamiltonian path is called a traceable graph. 
In general, the problem of finding a Hamiltonian path is NP-complete (Garey and Johnson 1983, pp. 199-200), 
so the only known way to determine whether a given general graph has a Hamiltonian path is to undertake an exhaustive search.
Any bipartite graph with a vertex parity unbalance > 1 has no Hamiltonian paths. 	

Application of topological ordering:
1. Representing course prerequisites.
2. In detecting deadlocks
3. Pipelining for computing jobs.
