Java NIO (New IO) is an alternative IO API for Java (from Java 1.4)
Alternative to standard Java IO and Java Networking API's.
In the standard IO API you work with byte streams and character streams. 
In NIO you work with channels and buffers. Data is always read from a channel into a buffer, 
or written from a buffer to a channel.

Java NIO enables you to do non-blocking IO.

Java NIO contains the concept of "selectors". A selector is an object that can monitor multiple channels for events (like: connection opened, data arrived etc.). 
Thus, a single thread can monitor multiple channels for data.
